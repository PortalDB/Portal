----------- REVIEW -----------
The paper presents a query language and a prototype implementation
for search and analysis of graphs that evolve over time, along
with a discussion of efficiency and scalability issues.

This is a very good topic, and the paper is interesting.
It is a perfect paper for a workshop.

Nonetheless, one is left wondering to what extent the proposed
query language is truly graph-specific.
Does it really differ from Temporal SQL with user-defined functions?
Is it powerful enough to express advanced analyses, for example:
which node pairs in the versioned history of graphs have never
had a shortest path longer than a given threshold?
which nodes have always been in the top-10 densest subgraphs throughout
the entire timeline?
which nodes have monotonically increasing PageRank?
and so on

----------- REVIEW -----------
The authors propose a novel system for querying and storing data on evolving graphs.

Evolving graphs are hot topic nowadays due to social network focused research, among others. However, the added temporal dimension results in increased complexity for storying, understanding and searching information related to such graphs. The authors propose to extend SQL query mechanisms and language for the case of temporal graphs, which is very attractive and useful objective.

The paper is written quite well and contains solid and details experiments. The authors made some choices as for the selection of graph processing methods: PageRank or trend analysis by regression and slope estimation. It would be interesting to see more discussion on the necessity of other methods in different real world scenarios as well as, perhaps, some user focused studies.

Overall, it is an example of solid work with underlying attractive objective and promising first results.

----------- REVIEW -----------
The authors describe work on infrastructure for analyzing graphs with an emphasis on evolution and temporal views. Iâ€™ve found the Portal system description very interesting and seems to have lots of potential. The content should of interest to the workshop participants.

An item for improvement: Figures 6-11 are somewhat unclear to read. Maybe the authors can do a better job at presenting the results of the computation on those different data sets?
