\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper we gave an overview of \ql, a declarative query language
for evolving graphs.  We described an implementation of \ql in scope
of Apache Spark, a distributed open-source processing framework.  Our
main focus here was on presenting several physical representations of
evolving graphs, and on experimentally evaluating their their relative
performance for several interesting analytics.

Our experiments demonstrate interesting trade-offs between spatial and
temporal locality.  This work opens many avenues for future work.  It
is in our immediate plans to start work on a query optimizer for \ql.
We will also implement and evaluate additional \tg representations
that explore the trade-off between density and compactness, and
between temporal and structural locality.  Finally, we are working on
extending the class of trend analytics, and on optimizing their
performance.
