Graphs are used to represent a plethora of phenomena, from the Web and
social networks, to biological pathways, to semantic knowledge
bases. Arguably the most interesting and important questions one can
ask about graphs have to do with their evolution. Which Web pages are
showing an increasing popularity trend? How does influence propagate
in social networks? How does knowledge evolve?  

In this paper we present our ongoing work on the \ql system, an
open-source distributed framework for evolving graph analytics.  Our
system implements a declarative query language by the same name.
\ql streamlines exploratory analysis of evolving graphs, making it
efficient and usable, and providing critical tools to computational
and data scientists.
