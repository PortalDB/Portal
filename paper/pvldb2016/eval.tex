\section{Evaluation of Portal queries}
\label{sec:eval}

We presented the syntax of the declarative query language \ql in
Section~\ref{sec:example}.  In this section we explain how \ql queries
are rewritten into a sequence of algebraic operators.  The discussion
in this section is independent of language implementation, which we
will discuss in Section~\ref{sec:system}.
