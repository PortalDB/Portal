Evolving graphs maintain history of changes of graph topology and of
attribute values over time.  These graphs have a specific temporal and
spatial resolution.  It is often useful to modify this resolution to
observe interesting patterns and trends.  In this paper we propose two
variants of an aggregation operator that supports this kind of
analysis of an evolving graph: attribute-based aggregation and
window-based aggregation.  Both variants are part of our temporal
graph algebra (TGA) and are implemented in a prototype system called
SystemXYZ, which runs on top of Apache Spark.  We review several
interesting use cases for the proposed operation, and provide an
extensive experimental evaluation with real evolving graph datasets,
demonstrating scalability.
