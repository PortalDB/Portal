\section{Take-Away Message}
\label{sec:conc}

This demonstration shows the utility of a query language for exploring
evolving graph questions.  Our working prototype provides interactive
optimized execution of user queries.  Users will also observe the
integration of \ql with SQL.  Users familiar with SQL will be able to
quickly learn \ql syntax and semantics and compose queries on the fly.
Those not familiar with SQL or other declarative languages can use the
query composition tool and will observe the ease of generating queries
graphically.
