\subsection{Extension: user-defined analytics}
\label{sec:analytics}

For many types of evolving graph analysis, it is necessary to compute
some property, such as PageRank of each vertex $v$, or the length of
the shortest path from a given designated vertex $u$ to each $v$, for
each representative graph.  This information can then be used to study
how the graph evolves over time.  \ql supports this type of analysis
through {\em temporal user-defined analytics}, which conceptually
execute an aggregation-map operation sequence repeatedly over a set
number of iterations or until fixpoint.\eat{analytic over each \rg,
  compute a value for each vertex of the \rg, and then store this
  value among the attributes of the vertex (adding it to the property
  bag).}  We provide an API that allows developers to implement custom
analytics that can be expressed in the popular Pregel
API~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/MalewiczABDHLC10}.

An analytic can be computed on each representative graph.  However, we
will show in Section~\ref{sec:exp} that more efficient methods that
use batching are possible.  \eat{Analytics cannot be computed directly on
\tve, because they must, by definition, act over representative
graphs.}
