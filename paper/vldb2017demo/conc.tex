\section{Take-Away Messages}
\label{sec:conc}

This demonstration presents \sys --- a system for declarative querying
and exploratory analysis of evolving graphs.  We will demonstrate the
utility of our system by allowing users to concisely specify
sophisticated analysis tasks, and have these tasks executed by \sys in
interactive time.  Users will observe the integration of \ql with SQL.

We are working to extend \sys in two directions.  Our query optimizer
is currently rule-based, and developing a cost model is in our
immediate plans.  For this demonstration, we will have several
physical plans prepared for the same query and observe the difference
in performance.  We are also planning to enable support for sequenced
semantics for \tga operations~\cite{MoffittEDBT17}, and to do so
efficiently in a distributed setting.

\eat{Users familiar with SQL will be able to quickly learn \ql syntax
  and semantics and compose queries on the fly.  Those not familiar
  with SQL or other declarative languages can use the query
  composition tool and will observe the ease of generating queries
  graphically.  Users will be able to quickly learn \ql syntax and
compose queries on the fly.  Users will observe that sophisticated
data exploration tasks can be stated concisely in \ql, and executed
efficiently by the framework.}
