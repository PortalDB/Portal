The evolving graph community has adopted a sequence of snapshots as
the logical representation of evolving graphs, that is graphs that
change over time and whose history of evolution we want to preserve
for analysis.  This paper argues that a snapshot sequence point-based
model of evolving graphs is insufficient for representation of a wide
range of networks.  Instead we propose to use an interval model with
sequenced semantics.  In this model nodes and edges are associated
with their validity intervals, and operations on the evolving graphs
adhere to the properties of snapshot reducibility, extended snapshot
reducibility, and change preservation.  We show the advantages of
adopting this model for evolving graphs and lay the groundwork for an
evolving graph query language.
