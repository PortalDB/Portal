The research community has adopted a sequence of snapshots as the
logical representation of evolving graphs --- graphs that change over
time and whose history of evolution we want to preserve for analysis.
This paper argues that the snapshot sequence model of evolving graphs
is insufficient for representation and analysis of a wide range of
networks.  Instead, we propose to use the interval model with
sequenced semantics.  In this model nodes and edges are associated
with their validity intervals, and operations adhere to the properties
of snapshot reducibility, extended snapshot reducibility, and change
preservation.  We show the advantages of adopting this model for
evolving graphs and lay the groundwork for an evolving graph query
language with sequenced semantics.  We also discuss several challenges
of efficiently supporting sequenced semantics in a distributed
setting.
