\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

We have argued that modeling evolving graphs using snapshot sequences
presents semantic difficulties.  As an alternative, we proposed a
vertex-edge model with sequence semantics and discussed several
challenges of supporting this model in a distributed setting.  We are
currently working on implementing this model in Apache Spark, and
exploring the performance of different physical representations and
partition strategies.

\eat{In the future we intend to investigate cost models of
  multi-operator queries where partitioning ...}
