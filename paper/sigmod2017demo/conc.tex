\section{Take-Away Messages}
\label{sec:conc}

This demonstration shows the utility of a query language for
exploratory analysis of evolving graph.  Our working prototype
provides interactive execution of user queries.  Users will
also observe the integration of \ql with SQL.\eat{Users familiar with
  SQL will be able to quickly learn \ql syntax and semantics and
  compose queries on the fly.  Those not familiar with SQL or other
  declarative languages can use the query composition tool and will
  observe the ease of generating queries graphically.}  Users will be
able to quickly learn \ql syntax and compose queries on the fly.
Users will observe that sophisticated data exploration tasks can be
stated concisely in \ql, and executed efficiently by the framework.
