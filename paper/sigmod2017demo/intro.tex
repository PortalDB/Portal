\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The development of SQL, a declarative query language for relational
data analysis, had a tremendous impact on the usability of database
technology, leading to its wide-spread adoption. At the same time, the
separation between the logical and the physical representations paved
the way for powerful performance optimizations. The motivation for our
research is to provide a similar tool for analyzing evolving graphs,
an area of interest in many research communities, including sociology,
epidemiology, networking, etc.

Analysis of {\em evolving graphs} has been receiving increasing
attention~\cite{DBLP:journals/csur/AggarwalS14,Miao2015,Ren2011,Semertzidis2015}.
Yet, despite much recent activity, and despite increased variety and
availability of evolving graph data, systematic support for scalable
querying and analysis of evolving graphs still lacks.  This support is
urgently needed, due first and foremost to the scalability and
efficiency challenges inherent in evolving graph analysis, but also to
considerations of usability and ease of dissemination.  The goal of
our work is to fill this gap.  In this demonstration we present
\sys, an open-source distributed framework that implements an
algebraic query language called \tg algebra~\cite{PortalarXiv2016}
(\tga) and a declarative language \ql over it. \sys streamlines
exploratory analysis of evolving graphs, making it efficient and
usable, and providing critical tools to computational and data
scientists.

Implementing (non-temporal) graph querying and analytics in an RDBMS
has been receiving renewed
attention~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/AbergerTOR16,DBLP:conf/sigmod/SunFSKHX15,DBLP:journals/pvldb/Xirogiannopoulos15}.
Our work is in-line with this trend.  Our goal in developing \sys is
to give users an ability to concisely express a wide range of common
analysis tasks over evolving graphs, while at the same time preserving
inter-operability with temporal relational algebra, and with
non-temporal relational operations.  We build on Apache Spark\eat{ /
GraphX~\cite{DBLP:conf/osdi/GonzalezXDCFS14} / Spark SQL}, an
open-source distributed system that combines data-parallel and
graph-parallel processing, to achieve scalability of graph processing
operations and inter-operability with SQL.

In what follows, we briefly describe our data model and algebra
(Section 2), and go on to present a declarative query language for
evolving graphs (Section 3) and the architecture of the \sys system
(Section 4) that implements it. We then present several interesting
demonstration scenarios (Section 5), in which sophisticated data
analysis tasks are specified concisely with declarative \ql queries,
and are executed in interactive time.  We finish with a brief
discussion of related work (Section 6) and with take-home messages
(Section 7).
