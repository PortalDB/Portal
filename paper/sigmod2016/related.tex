\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

In this paper We will build upon, and non-trivially extend, the graph
processing abstractions of Apache Spark, a popular open-source
distributed data processing engine, and specifically of
GraphX~\cite{DBLP:conf/osdi/GonzalezXDCFS14}.  

Our work shares motivation with recent work by Miao et
al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/tos/MiaoHLWYZPCC15}, who developed an
in-memory execution engine for temporal graph analytics.  Unlike Miao
et al., who focus on in-memory layout and locality-aware scheduling
mechanisms, we work in a distributed storage and processing
environment.  

Amol's work: snapshot retrieval and anything else that is relevant.
