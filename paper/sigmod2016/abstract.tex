Graphs are used to represent a plethora of phenomena, from the Web and
social networks, to biological pathways, to semantic knowledge
bases. Arguably the most interesting and important questions one can
ask about graphs have to do with their evolution. Which Web pages are
showing an increasing popularity trend? How does influence propagate
in social networks? How does knowledge evolve?

Much research and engineering effort today goes into developing
sophisticated graph analytics and their efficient implementations,
both stand-alone and in scope of data processing platforms. Yet, {\em
  systematic support} for scalable querying and analytics over {\em
  evolving graphs} still lacks.

In this paper we present \ql, a declarative language that supports
efficient querying and exploratory analysis of evolving graphs, and an
implementation of \ql in scope of Apache Spark, an open-source
distributed data processing framework.  Our language supports novel
operations including temporal aggregation, union and intersection, and
a rich class of analytics.  We develop multiple physical
representations and partitioning strategies and study the trade-offs
between structural and temporal locality.  We provide an extensive
experimental evaluation of our system, demonstrating that careful
engineering can lead to good performance.
