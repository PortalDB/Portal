\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:exp}

{\bf Data and evaluation methods.}  We evaluate performance of our
framework on three real open-source datasets.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item DBLP\footnote{\url{dblp.uni-trier.de/xml}} contains co-authorship
  information from 1936 through 2015, with over 1.5 million author
  nodes and over 6 million undirected co-authorship edges.  

\item nGrams\footnote{\url{storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html}}
  contains word co-occurrence information from 1520 through 2008, with
  over 1.5 million word nodes and over 65 million undirected
  co-occurrence edges.

\item
  DELIS\footnote{\url{law.di.unimi.it/webdata/uk-union-2006-06-2007-05}}
  contains monthly snapshots, from 05/2006 through 05/2007, of a
  portion of the Web graph focusing on the .uk domains, with a total
  of over 133 million nodes and over 5.5 billion directed
  edges~\cite{BSVLTAG}.

\end{enumerate}

Our evaluation focuses on efficiency of implementation. Experiments
are conducted on an in-house 8-node Hadoop cluster built with Open
Stack. \reminder{Additional details about nodes, distribution.}
