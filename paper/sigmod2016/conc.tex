\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conc}

While the Portal language is extensive, it is by no means complete. We
recognize that there are a number of operations that are currently not
supported but would be useful to potential users:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Temporal pattern matching.  While aggregation provides an
  ability to detect some patters, a more general temporal-structural
  pattern mining is needed.  Work on specifying structural patterns in
  graphs is ongoing, however, at the time of this writing we are not
  aware of a general approach for specifying structural patterns that
  also have a time dimension.  For example, how should the user
  specify that he/she is looking for small strongly connected
  components that exhibit consistent growth over a period of time?
  Some work on this front has been done by Chan et
  al~\cite{Chan2008,Kan2009}.
\item Structural select (subgraph).  \vera{we have this in the api but
  not in the language.}
\item Other kinds of temporal select besides by interval, such as with
  predicates, similar to snapshot selection support
  in~\cite{Khurana2013}. \vera{again, we have this in the api but not
    in the language.}
\item Across-time analytics (unlike spanshot-based analytics,
  e.g. pagerank) like the centrality metric for dynamic networks,
  where influence of a vertex propagates through time.
\item Anything that would return not another tgraph.  This could be
  measures of a whole graph (measure of centrality, degree
  distribution, diameter, etc.) or searching that returns a set of tgraphs,
  e.g. frequent pattern mining).
\end{enumerate}
