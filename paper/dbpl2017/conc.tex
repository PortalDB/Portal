\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper we presented \tga: an extension of the property graph
model with tuple timestamping for evolving graphs, and a rich set of
operations with point semantics.  TGA is ungrouped, snapshot
reducible, and extended snapshot reducible.  We examined several use
cases and showed how \tga can be used to express them.

\eat{A model previously used in the literature, a sequence of snapshots,
can be computed from our model with a slice over all time points.  We
emphasize that the choice of the logical model impacts the
expressiveness of the algebra and advocate our model over the snapshot
sequence from that perspective.  Our model supports fully evolved
graphs% (both topological and attribute evolution for both nodes and edges)
, uses time intervals for time granularity, and provides both
graph-centric and entity-centric views.}

One of the limitations of \tga that prevents its temporal completeness
is lack of change preservation as part of sequence semantics.  Work on
adapting \tga for sequence semantics is in
progress~\cite{MoffittEDBT17}.
%
We have developed a prototype implementation of \tga in scope of
Apache Spark, which we will make available to the public shortly.  It
is in our immediate plans to develop a declarative syntax for \tga,
making it accessible to a wider audience of users.
