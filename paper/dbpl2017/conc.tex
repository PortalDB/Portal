\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper we presented \tga: a tuple-stamped vertex and edge model
of evolving graphs and a rich set of operations with point semantics.
TGA is ungrouped and snapshot reducible.  We examined several use
cases and showed how \tga can be used to express them.

We have developed a prototype implementation of \tga in scope of
Apache Spark, which we will make available to the public shortly.  It
is in our immediate plans to develop a declarative syntax for \tga,
making it accessible to a wider audience of users.
