Graph representations underlie many modern computer applications,
capturing the structure of such diverse networks as the Internet,
personal associations, roads, sensors, and metabolic pathways.  While
the static structure of graphs is a well-explored field, a new
emphasis is being placed on understanding and representing the way
these networks change over time.  Current research is delving into
graph evolution rate and mechanisms, the impact of specific events on
network evolution, and spatial and spatiotemporal patterns.  However,
systematic support for scalable querying and analytics over evolving
graphs still lacks.

In this paper, we combine the theoretical and practical
advances in graph databases and temporal relational databases to
formulate an evolving graph model, including a representation and an
algebra.  With this model we aim to enable a systematic support for
the evolving graph analysis, heretofore lacking in generality.  Our
goal is to give users an ability to concisely express a wide range of
common analysis tasks.  We provide several use cases to motivate our
work and demonstrate how they are supported in our model.  We show
that our algebra is strictly more expressive than the currently
published state of the art and provides additional operations not
available to the users today.
