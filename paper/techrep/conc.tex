\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper we presented \ql, a declarative query language for
evolving graphs.  We also proposed an implementation of \ql in scope
of Apache Spark, a distributed open-source processing framework.  We
implemented several physical representations of evolving graphs, and
several partitioning strategies, and studied their relative
performance for \ql operators.  

Our experiments demonstrate interesting trade-offs between spatial and
temporal locality.  This work opens many avenues for future work.  It
is in our immediate plans to start work on a query optimizer for \ql.
We will also implement and evaluate additional \tg representations
that explore the trade-off between density and compactness, and
between temporal and structural locality.  Finally, we are working on
extending the class of trend analytics, and on optimizing the
performance of snapshot and trend analytics.
