## Overview
Portal is a system for efficient querying and exploratory analysis of evolving graphs, built on Apache Spark. 

## Temporal Graph
Portal implements an algebraic query language called TGraph algebra (TGA). A TGraph represents evolution of a single graph, e.g., the Web. A snapshot of a TGraph is the state of the relations at any time point. TGraph relations are coalesced â€” each fact is represented exactly once for each time period of maximal length during which it holds. Referential integrity holds on E w.r.t. V, guaranteeing that edges only exist if their end points exist at the same time, on VA w.r.t. V, and on EA w.r.t. E
